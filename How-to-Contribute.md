## Updating the Wiki

Changes to wiki pages can be made using the GitHub editor or by cloning the wiki locally using git.  The URL is the following:

    git clone https://github.com/project-geode/docs.wiki.git

This copies the markdown (.md) files locally where they can be edited and updated using standard git commands (`git commit` and `git push`).  Images can be stored in the `images/` folder and referenced using `[[images/imageName.png]]` in your wiki page.  The wiki pages can also be edited using a markdown editor like [Mou](http://25.io/mou/) or Sublime.
