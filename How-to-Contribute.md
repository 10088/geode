## Updating the Wiki

* You can (and should) clone the actual wiki locally just like anything on Git.  The URL is the following: 

` git clone https://github.com/gemfire/apache-gemfire-staging.wiki.git`

* After cloning you end up with a bunch of .md (Markdown) files.
* I've just created an images folder.  So after cloning it just add your files and following the git procedures as usual (`git commit` and `git push`).
* To reference the image in your text just use `[[images/imageName.png]]` - Using the relative path.
* There is a sidebar now with some structure and we should be adding more stuff from Gemstone community site soon.

> Another tip is that you can edit your Markdown files using some editor like Mou (http://25.io/mou/) , Sublime (with plugins) or GitHub web editor and preview the content just like any wiki.
