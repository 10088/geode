Review Process and Maintainers
Fuego development follows the Apache voting process, where changes to the code are approved through consensus. We use a review-then-commit model, where at least one committer other than the patch author has to review and approve it before it gets merged, and any committer may vote against it. For certain modules, changes to the architecture and public API should also be reviewed by a maintainer for that module (which may or may not be the same as the main reviewer) before being merged. Fuego has designated the following maintainers:

****TBD - modules and maintainers

Note that the maintainers in Fuego do not "own" each module – every committer is responsible for the quality of the whole codebase. Instead, maintainers are asked to ensure that public APIs and changes to complex components are designed consistently. Any committer may contribute to any module, and any committer may review any code change. If maintainers do not respond to a change within a reasonable amount of time, other committers may also merge it and ask the PMC to add more maintainers for that module.

Becoming a Committer
To get started contributing to Fuego, learn how to contribute – anyone can submit patches, documentation and examples to the project.

The qualifications for new committers include:
Sustained contributions to Fuego: Committers should have a history of major contributions to Fuego. An ideal committer will have contributed broadly throughout the project, and have contributed at least one major component where they have taken an "ownership" role. An ownership role means that existing contributors feel that they should run patches for this component by this person.

Quality of contributions: Committers more than any other community member should submit simple, well-tested, and well-designed patches. In addition, they should show sufficient expertise to be able to review patches, including making sure they fit within Spark's engineering practices (testability, documentation, API stability, code style, etc). The committership is collectively responsible for the software quality and maintainability of Fuego.

Community involvement: Committers should have a constructive and friendly attitude in all community interactions. They should also be active on the dev and user list and help mentor newer contributors and users. In design discussions, committers should maintain a professional and diplomatic approach, even in the face of disagreement.
The type and level of contributions considered may vary by project area -- for example, we greatly encourage contributors who want to work on mainly the documentation, or mainly on platform support for specific OSes, storage systems, etc.
