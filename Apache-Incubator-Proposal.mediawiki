== Abstract ==
FireBunny is a data management platform that provides real-time, consistent access to data-intensive applications throughout widely distributed cloud architectures.

FireBunny pools memory, CPU, network resources, and optionally local disk across multiple processes to manage application objects and behavior. It uses dynamic replication and data partitioning techniques to implement high availability, improved performance, scalability, and fault tolerance. In addition to being a distributed data container, FireBunny is an in-memory data management system that provides reliable asynchronous event notifications and guaranteed message delivery.

== Proposal ==
This proposal aims at bringing existing Pivotal GemFire codebase under the governance model of the Apache Software Foundation with the goal of building a vibrant, diverse and self-governed open source community around the technology. Pivotal will keep marketing and selling a product called "GemFire" which is expected to be based on the released versions of FireBunny. The project and Pivotal product are expected to be managed in a fully independent way. The artifacts covered by this proposal are: source code (mostly Java), documentation, and website currently available on GitHub under the ALv2.

== Background ==
GemFire is an extremely mature and robust product that can trace its legacy all the way back to one of the first original Object Databases for Smalltalk: GemStone. For all these years, GemFire code base has been maintained by the same group of engineers as a closed source project. The original company developing GemStone and GemFire was acquired by VMWare in 2010 and later spun off as part of Pivotal Software in 2013. Today GemFire is used by over XXX production deployments managing YYYY Tb of data in an average deployment.

== Rationale ==
Modern day datacenter architectures require a robust in-memory data grid (IDG) technology to handle variety of usecases ranging from enterprise-wide Caching all the way to real-time transactional applications at scale. In addition to that, the trajectory of hardware evolution in enterprise datacenters (with memory size and network bandwidth growth far outpacing disk) suggests that the importance of managing large pools of RAM at scale will only increase with time. Thus it is vital to stay on the bleeding edge of innovation and our conviction is that it is only possible as part of a vibrant, diverse, self-governed community innovating around a robust codebase while at the same cross-pollinating with various other data management communities. Today, the only place that allows for that is Apache Software Foundation.

== Initial Goals ==
The initial goals of the GemFire transition under the ASF umbrella are focused on moving the internal engineering processes out in the open and fostering the collaborative development model according to the "Apache Way". We expect to invest a lot of resources into not only developing new functionality in the open and community-governed way, but also into refactoring of the existing internal build, test and release processes.

== Current Status ==
Currently the project code base is licensed under ALv2 and it is available in a public github.com repository (http://github.com/pivotal/fire-bunny). The same repository hosts documentation and wiki pages. 

Even though so far the project has been developed as a proprietary, close-source product, the internal engineering practices adopted by the development team lend themselves easily to the open, collaborative and meritocratic environment. 

Being predominantly API-driven, developer-centric product, there's been a considerable effort around building a robust end user community of paying and non-paying customers. Our existing investment in documentation, StackOverflow, etc. are expected to facilitate conversions of some of our existing users into active community members and developers. 

=== Meritocracy ===
The proposed list of initial committers on the project include the original GemFire R&D team, Pivotal Field Engineers and a few existing customers and partners. This group will form a base for the much broader community that we will be inviting to collaborate on the existing code base.

We want to radically expand that initial developer and user community by running the project in 
accordance with the "Apache Way" clearly signaling not only the licensing, but also the governance 
choice.

Users and new contributors will be treated with respect and welcomed; they will earn 
merit in the project by providing quality patches and support that move the project forward.
They also will be encouraged to provide non-code contributions (documentation, events,
community management, etc.) and will gain merit for doing so.

Those with a proven support and quality track record will be encouraged to become committers.

=== Community ===
If FireBunny is accepted by the Incubator, transitioning the core community to embrace the Apache Way of governance would be a primary initial goal. We would solicit major existing contributors to become committers on the project from the get go.

=== Core Developers ===

Core developers include some of the folks who are extremely skilled in working in the openly
governed communities on code bases license under the ALv2. Most of the core developers are
currently NOT affiliated with the ASF and would require new ICLAs to be filed.

FIXME: please provide short introductions of the few members of the team who you would expect
to be mostly active driving open source community agenda. 

=== Alignment ===

The following existing ASF projects can be considered when reviewing FireBunny
   * Apache Ignite (incubating)
   * Apache Cassandra
   * Apache Hadoop
   * Apache Storm
   * Apache Spark
   * Apache Kafka and Samza

FIXME: please provide short compare-n-contrast with all of the above

== Known Risks ==
As noted above, development has been sponsored mostly by a single company and coordinated
mostly by the core team so far.

For the project to fully transition to an "Apache Way" governance model it needs to
start embracing the meritocracy-centric way of growing the community of contributors
while balancing it with the needs for extreme stability and coherency of the core
implementation.

The tools and development practices that were in place for development of the closed-source
GemFire product are mostly compatible with the ones offered by the ASF infrastructure and
thus we don't anticipate any on-boarding pains. Same goes for migration from its current
github.com location. There wasn't much of a project accumulated there to worry about
transition costs.

=== Orphaned products ===
Pivotal is fully committed to delivering GemFire product based on technology developed as part of
FireBunny project. Given the strategic importance of a successful GemFire product the risk of
Pivotal cutting support to developers working on the proposed project is minimal.

On top of that, the proposers have a vested interest in making FireBunny succeed, driving its development and its integration with sister ASF projects thereby reducing the risk of an orphaned product even further.

=== Inexperience with Open Source ===
While most of the initial committers haven't been exposed to developing 100% community-driven, open source projects as their day job there are a few veteran ASF folks (ASF members, committers and PMC members) included in this proposal. The project will rely on their guidance and the collective wisdom of its mentors to quickly transition the entire team of initial committers to practicing the "Apache Way".

=== Homogeneous Developers ===
While most of the initial committers are employed by a single company, we have seen a health level of interest from our existing customers and partners already. We hope to convert that interest in direct participation and will be investing in activities around recruiting additional committers from other companies.

=== Reliance on Salaried Developers ===
Most of the contributors are paid to work in the big data space.  
While we might wander from our current employers, we probably won’t 
go far from our core expertise and thus will continue being engaged
with the project regardless of the current employer.

=== Relationships with Other Apache Products ===
As mentioned in the Alignment section, FireBunny may consider varies degrees of integration and code exchange with Apache Ignite (incubating), Apache Hadoop, Apache Storm, Apache Spark and Apache Kafka/Samza. Given the success that GemFire product enjoyed being used as an embedded service we would expect integration points to be inside and outside of the project. In general, we look forward to collaborating with those communities, as well as other Apache communities.

=== An Excessive Fascination with the Apache Brand ===
While we intend to leverage the Apache ‘branding’ when talking to other 
projects as testament of our project’s ‘neutrality’, we have no plans 
for making use of Apache brand in press releases nor posting billboards 
advertising acceptance of FireBunny into Apache Incubator. 

== Documentation ==
See [[http://XXXX|documentation]] for the current state of the project 
documentation.

A mature project website is also available at [[http://XXXX/|FireBunnyHome]].

== Initial Source ==
Initial source is available on GitHub under the ALv2 [[https://github.com/groovy/groovy-core|groovy-core]]
 

== Source and Intellectual Property Submission Plan ==
We know of no legal encumberments in the way of transfer of source to Apache. In fact, given the
series of corporate due diligence procedures performed on the source code during two of the
acquisitions we expect the code base to be squeaky clean from an IP perspective.
